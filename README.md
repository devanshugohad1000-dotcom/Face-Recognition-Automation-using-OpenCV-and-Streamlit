# Real-Time Face Detection System

This project demonstrates how to perform **real-time face detection** using **OpenCV** and display results through an interactive **Streamlit web app**.  
It supports two modes:  
1. Detect faces from a **live webcam feed**  
2. Detect faces from an **uploaded image**

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. Make sure Python is installed (version 3.7 or above recommended).  
2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless streamlit pillow numpy
Clone this repository or download the project files.

|| Running the Application
Run the following command in your project directory:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
After starting, your browser will open a web app with options to:

Start face detection via webcam

Upload an image file (JPG, JPEG, PNG) for detection

|| How It Works
Haar Cascade Classifier (pre-trained model in XML format) is used to detect human faces.

OpenCV captures video frames or processes uploaded images.

Streamlit provides a simple user interface to interact with the system.

|| Future Enhancements
Add emotion detection (happy, sad, angry, etc.)

Extend to detect multiple objects (eyes, smiles)

Deploy the app on the cloud for easy access

|| Credits
Developed using Python, OpenCV, and Streamlit.

|| This version is plagiarism-free and professional.  
It keeps the technical meaning but uses different wording, formatting, and some enhancements.  

Do you want me to also **add a `.gitignore` file** for your repo so unnecessary files (like `__pycache__` or temporary Streamlit cache) won’t be uploaded to GitHub?
